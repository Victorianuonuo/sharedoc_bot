# Nudge Bot

### Purpose

The goal of this project is to drive behavior change by delivering personalized nudges that are informed by habitual patterns inferred from each userâ€™s personal digital traces. Behavioral Economists define a nudge as an intervention that steers people in a particular direction but without forcing them to take an action. In this project, we will deliver digital nudges through slack.

### Overview

In this project, we will deliver digital nudges through slack.

This Nudge Bot is built using many asynchronous API's. The core API used is Slackbots. The bot will start the conversation by explaining its functions. It would tell the user to send the share link of the doc that the user want to track the daily progress on and send daily reminder to the user of their progress.

## Set up

First you need to install node.js, which is what we use in this project. Instructions can be found [here.](https://medium.com/@js_tut/installing-node-js-on-pc-mac-and-linux-getting-started-with-react-from-scratch-ea24653e0ab4)

Then `npm install` to install the packages need.

After installing the packages you need, there are still some environment variables you need to set up to run this bot,

**DOMAIN**: *Heroku domain name*

**MONGODB_URI**: *Mongo DB credentials*

**NUDGE_BOT_TOKEN**: *Bot User OAuth Access Token*

**TZ**: America/New_York *The timezone you are in*

**NUDGE_BOT_TOKEN, DOMAIN**: You will need to create a slack bot and deploy it to heroku( or ngrok as long as it has domain name for the app to be registered in Google API), then get the token for the bot and domain name. Instructions on how to do this and set up environment variables in heroku can be found [here.](https://medium.com/@alexstroulger/how-to-build-a-slackbot-600635b12a38)

*Since the free version of Heroku has been used, the server will automatically sleep after 30 minutes. To prevent it from sleeping, I implemented a function in the code that will send a HTTP request every 10 minutes.*

**MONGODB_URI**: You will also need to set up a mongodb. Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](http://fredrik.anderzon.se/2017/01/17/setting-up-a-free-mongodb-database-on-mlab-and-connecting-to-it-with-node-js/). Use the URL mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@\*.mlab.com:\*/\* as MONGODB_URI.

**TZ**: Set which time zone you would want the bot to be. List of tz database time zones can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)

Finally, set all of your environmental variables in heroku.
